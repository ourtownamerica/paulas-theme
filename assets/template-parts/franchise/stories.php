								<p>"I’ve been in outside sales for many years working for several companies. I was successful at making them money, but my own personal reward wasn’t ever to my expectations. I decided to look into a franchise system where I can be my own boss, have a flexible schedule & have that balance in life between work & family. I have found that with Our Town America. It’s the perfect system for my needs. I can work from home & out of my truck. I don’t have any employees to deal with, no overhead & no inventory. The support & training from corporate never ends & helps me be as successful as I can be. I now have the personal & financial freedom I’ve been looking for!"</p>

								<p>"I left the corporate arena & I needed an opportunity where I could make a decent income. We went to work immediately when we bought our franchise & we worked extremely hard to get to where we are... but I'll tell you what - there has been a lot of success both from a personal standpoint & a financial standpoint. I think I made a great decision as far as coming onboard with Our Town."</p>

								<p>"My husband Tom & I became franchisees after a layoff from a corporate downsizing. The appeal of owning a community oriented business was enticing to us as we both had sales backgrounds & Our Town America offered us the opportunity to work local without having to travel & be away from the family. We love that we get to help local business owners grow their businesses by directing new residents in their doors each & every month. This business model is perfect for us as we can work from home with no overhead, we have the support of the corporate office that is always responsive & supportive, & OTA allows us to grow our residual income with an unlimited earning potential."</p>
